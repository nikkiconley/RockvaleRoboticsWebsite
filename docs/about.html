      <p>This year's robot was built to meet this year's competition theme: "Off the Grid." The robot is able to
      complete several "power restoration" activities. It can install conduit pipe, remove debris, and install substation transformers.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Rockvale Middle School Robotics Team partnered up with linemen from Middle Tennessee Electric to read the kindergarten and 1st-grade
         students at Rockvale Elementary School about the dangerous, but vital work done by electrical linemen.</p>

      <p>Sunday afternoon, the Rockvale Robotics Team lit up the homes of senior citizens with new energy-efficient LED lightbulbs. This outreach activity was done with the cooperation with Middle Tennessee Electric, who provided the lightbulbs, and the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office, who provided the names and addresses of elderly citizens in our community. The Sheriff’s Office operates a program called Senior Citizens Awareness Network (SCAN) where officers volunteer their time to visit seniors citizens at their homes to provide safety and security services.</p>
