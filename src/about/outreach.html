          <p>As far as selling a robot for community service, the design will need to be inspiring to other people and helpful. Especially since the design for this year’s competition is based on Medical Robotics, the designs will need to be helpful in Healthcare, along with so much more. Obviously, a lot of the needs for a robot will consist in designs and coding. When selling however, the first impression is everything. From how it looks, works, and is explained all matter. Sellers need to be ready for anything, too. Let’s say the judge buying your product asks about how it can help the community. Sellers need to be prepared for knowing what to say in times like this and making sure the product is explained well. For example, a person could respond with, “Well, our product can help with the number of vaccines handed to patients and giving patients the items, they are needed medically.” With selling products, it’s easy to think one should go overboard with the designs, but a lot of that isn't necessary. It’s important to acknowledge your products organized and working of course but doing anything out of comfort zone isn't needed at all. It’s like having a job interview. Making sure your words are confident and your products is ready is very important with selling.
