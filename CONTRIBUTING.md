# Contributing
## Code
### Rules
To contribute, please follow these rules:
HTML shall adhere to the HTML 5 specifications.
Inline CSS shall not be permitted.
JavaScript should not be inline.
Images should be SVGs.

### Tech stack
We use npm to manage our dependencies:
- Bootstrap 4
- jQuery
- popper.js

jQuery is only used for integration with Bootstrap. Same with popper.js.


## Submitting
It is recommended that GitHub Desktop is installed to contribute (if you're not a command line wizard). Clone the repository and open it in GitHub Desktop.
1. Create a new pull request. (This should be to the active fork. For example, if version 2.0 is in development, create the request under `v2.0` not `master`.)
2. Wait for merge.
3. Done!

If you have trouble, please consult GitHub's documentation.
